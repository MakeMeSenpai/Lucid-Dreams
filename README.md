    EXT. MOON - AFTERNOON

Witty doctor DR WILL WU is arguing with delightful nurse MS KATHY PARKER. WILL tries to hug KATHY but she shakes him off.

WILL
Please Kathy, don't leave me.
KATHY
I'm sorry Will, but I'm looking for somebody a bit more brave. Somebody who faces his fears head on, instead of running away.
WILL
I am such a person!
KATHY frowns.

KATHY
I'm sorry, Will. I just don't feel excited by this relationship anymore.
KATHY leaves.

WILL sits down, looking defeated.

Moments later, special Teacher PROF ANDY PARKER barges in looking flustered.

WILL
Goodness, Andy! Is everything okay?
ANDY
I'm afraid not.
WILL
What is it? Don't keep me in suspense...
ANDY
It's ... a Tarrasque ... I saw an evil Tarrasque murder a bunch of kittens!
WILL
Defenseless kittens?
ANDY
Yes, defenseless kittens!
WILL
Bloomin' heck, Andy! We've got to do something.
ANDY
I agree, but I wouldn't know where to start.
WILL
You can start by telling me where this happened, Andy!
ANDY
I was...
ANDY fans himself and begins to wheeze.

WILL
Focus Mother Trucker, focus! Where did it happen?
ANDY
Hospital! That's right - Hospital!
WILL springs up and begins to run.


EXT. A ROAD - CONTINUOUS

WILL rushes along the street, followed by ANDY. They take a short cut through some back gardens, jumping fences along the way.


INT. HOSPITAL - SHORTLY AFTER

CHLOE SLAUGHTERHOUSE a brutal Tarrasque terrorises two kittens.

WILL, closely followed by ANDY, rushes towards CHLOE, but suddenly stops in his tracks.

ANDY
What is it? What's the matter?
WILL
That's not just any old Tarrasque, that's Chloe Slaughterhouse!
ANDY
Who's Chloe Slaughterhouse?
WILL
Who's Chloe Slaughterhouse? Who's Chloe Slaughterhouse? Only the most brutal Tarrasque in the universe!
ANDY
Blinkin' knickers, Will! We're going to need some help if we're going to stop the most brutal Tarrasque in the universe!
WILL
You can say that again.
ANDY
Blinkin' knickers, Will! We're going to need some help if we're going to stop the most brutal Tarrasque in the universe!
WILL
I'm going to need guns, lots of guns.
Chloe turns and sees Will and Andy. She grins an evil grin.

CHLOE
Will Wu, we meet again.
ANDY
You've met?
WILL
Yes. It was a long, long time ago...

EXT. A PARK - BACK IN TIME

A young WILL is sitting in a park listening to some jazz music, when suddenly a dark shadow casts over him.

He looks up and sees CHLOE. He takes off his headphones.

CHLOE
Would you like some chocolate?
WILL's eyes light up, but then he studies CHLOE more closely, and looks uneasy.

WILL
I don't know, you look kind of brutal.
CHLOE
Me? No. I'm not brutal. I'm the least brutal Tarrasque in the world.
WILL
Wait, you're a Tarrasque?
WILL runs away, screaming.


INT. HOSPITAL - PRESENT DAY

CHLOE
You were a coward then, and you are a coward now.
ANDY
(To WILL) You ran away?
WILL
(To ANDY) I was just a kid. What was I supposed to do?
WILL turns to CHLOE.

WILL
I may have run away from you then, but I won't run away this time!
WILL runs away.

He turns back and shouts.

WILL
I mean, I am running away, but I'll be back - with pistols.
CHLOE
I'm not scared of you.
WILL
You should be.

EXT. MIDDLE EARTH - LATER THAT DAY

WILL and ANDY walk around searching for something.

WILL
I feel sure I left my pistols somewhere around here.
ANDY
Are you sure? It does seem like an odd place to keep deadly pistols.
WILL
You know nothing Andy Parker.
ANDY
We've been searching for ages. I really don't think they're here.
Suddenly, CHLOE appears, holding a pair of pistols.

CHLOE
Looking for something?
ANDY
Crikey, Will, she's got your pistols.
WILL
Tell me something I don't already know!
ANDY
The earth's circumference at the equator is about 40,075 km.
WILL
I know that already!
ANDY
I bite my toenails.
CHLOE
(appalled) Dude!
While CHLOE is looking at ANDY with disgust, WILL lunges forward and grabs his deadly pistols. He wields them, triumphantly.

WILL
Prepare to die, you brutal turnip!
CHLOE
No please! All I did was murder a bunch of kittens!
KATHY enters, unseen by any of the others.

WILL
I cannot tolerate that kind of behaviour! Those kittens were defenceless! But now they have a defender - and that's me! Will Wu defender of innocent kittens.
CHLOE
Don't hurt me! Please!
WILL
Give me one good reason why I shouldn't use these pistols on you right away!
CHLOE
Because Will, I am your mother.
WILL looks stunned for a few moments, but then collects himself.

WILL
No you're not!
CHLOE
Ah well, it had to be worth a try.
CHLOE tries to grab the pistols but WILL dodges out of the way.

WILL
Who's the mummy now? Huh? Huh?
Unexpectedly, CHLOE slumps to the ground.

ANDY
Did she just faint?
WILL
I think so. Well that's disappointing. I was rather hoping for a more dramatic conclusion, involving my deadly pistols.
WILL crouches over CHLOE's body.

ANDY
Be careful, Will. It could be a trick.
WILL
No, it's not a trick. It appears that... It would seem... Chloe Slaughterhouse is dead!
WILL
What?
WILL
Yes, it appears that I scared her to death.
ANDY claps his hands.

ANDY
So your pistols did save the day, after all.
KATHY steps forward.

KATHY
Is it true? Did you kill the brutal Tarrasque?
WILL
Kathy how long have you been...?
KATHY puts her arm around WILL.

KATHY
Long enough.
WILL
Then you saw it for yourself. I killed Chloe Slaughterhouse.
KATHY
Then the kittens are safe?
WILL
It does seem that way!
A crowd of vulnerable kittens enter, looking relived.

KATHY
You are their hero.
The kittens bow to WILL.

WILL
There is no need to bow to me. I seek no worship. The knowledge that Chloe Slaughterhouse will never murder kittens ever again, is enough for me.
KATHY
You are humble as well as brave!
One of the kittens passes WILL a magic necklace

KATHY
I think they want you to have it, as a symbol of their gratitude.
WILL
I couldn't possibly.
Pause.

WILL
Well, if you insist.
WILL takes the necklace.

WILL
Thank you.
The kittens bow their heads once more, and leave.

WILL turns to KATHY.

WILL
Does this mean you want me back?
KATHY
Oh, Will, of course I want you back!
WILL smiles for a few seconds, but then looks defiant.

WILL
Well you can't have me.
KATHY
WHAT?
WILL
You had no faith in me. You had to see my scare a Tarrasque to death before you would believe in me. I don't want a lover like that.
KATHY
But...
WILL
Please leave. I want to spend time with the one person who stayed with me through thick and thin - my best friend, Andy.
ANDY grins.

KATHY
But...
ANDY
You heard the gentleman. Now be off with you. Skidaddle! Shoo!
KATHY
Will?
WILL
I'm sorry Kathy, but I think you should skidaddle.
KATHY leaves.

ANDY turns to WILL.

ANDY
Did you mean that? You know ... that I'm your best friend?
WILL
Of course you are!
The two walk off arm in arm.

Suddenly ANDY stops.

ANDY
When I said I bite my toenails, you know I was just trying to distract the Tarrasque don't you?

Will wakes up in his bed from his dream. he then realizes that it was all a dream and walks outside his house after getting ready for work.

ANDY
Goodmorning Dr. Wu, later today would you like to come to my BBQ?
WILL
Goodmorning Nieghbor. I'll surely try but you know how work goes.
ANDY
Well no worries, we are both busy men after all
Will
Yeah.. it appears so.

WIll walks away, looking upset and bored. then enters the tram. 

Will works at the hospital were he sees ANDY's sister KATHY who is a nurse at the hospital he works at.

KATHY
Hello Will, ready for another day of work?

WILL
just another day at the job I guess.

KATHY
Then how about we go get lunch together during your next break?

WILL flustered
I'm sorry, not today. Besides, you know your brother wouldn't like us talking.

KATHY
Oh stop! Andy likes you, and what would be wrong with us going on more time?

WILL
I'm sorry Kathy, but no. Being friends with someone and being okay with them dating his sister are two different things. And our friendship means more to me than to ruin it this way. 

KATHY
Psh, whatever. You are just a coward!

WILL Walks away saying
I guess I am..

WILL then walks into the clinics room and checks a clipboard
then shadows over a female paitent.

WILL reads out loud
Chloe Slaughterhouse, found passed out next to her painting of a tesseraque. Presumable becuase of shock when a burgurlar entering her kitchen window. She has been like this for 2 days

WILL then sees and reaches for her neckalous
It can't be...

Will reaching for the neckalous than hears her heart rate flat lines.  He is stuck with panic and shocks her to life.

CHLOE
*breaths heavily* Where am I?!

WIll
It's okay, you are in the hospital. You have been asleep for a few days.

CHLOE
A few days?! I have to get home! I have to take care of my kittens!

WILL
I'm sorry, but I can't let you do that. We have no idea what kind of state you are in right now.

CHLOE 
But I don't want my kittens to die! They are all I have left!

WILL
Okay! Okay, I'll take you to your kittens. But we will have to go now before any of the other nurses or Doctors find out that you have woken up.

CHLOE
Oh Thank you! Thank you!

WILL
SHH, Thank me later. We should go now!

WILL followed by CHLOE sneak out of the hospital, and WIll calls a taxi for them to leave in.

At CHLOES house. Filled with kittens, furniture and paintings. Still a mess from the burgalur

CHLOE
I'm so glad that fiend spilt all the cat food. 

WILL
They were just a bit dehydrated but they should be okay now. BUt what about you, how are you feeling?

CHLOE
I feel alright. A lot better now that I have my Kittens here with me. But could you stay a bit longer. I know I have to go back to the hospital but you can take care of the place for me right?

WILL
Of course. but how will I get in?

CHLOE then hands him her neckalous, which is revealed to be a hidden key. 

CHLOE
Please take care of it for me. 

WILL takes the neckalous with lots of emotion, staring into CHLOE's beautiful eyes. They both get flustered. And end up holding hands gently on the couch.
THE END
